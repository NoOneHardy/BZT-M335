## Concept

In broody the user can save his plans for the gym and start them to look up what configurations they have to use or how much weight they used last time.

**Icon**  
The icon was generated by Bing using a prompt generated by ChatGPT.  
I implemented it in Android Studio by generating a new Resource with the ai-generated png file.

**Name**  
Broody is inspired by roody, the app of my gym.  
Roody has a lot of bugs, so I wanted to make something better.  
That's why my app is called broody (**b***etter* **roody**).

**Theme**   
The app design has a theme color which depends on the battery level of the phone.

| Battery status | Theme color |
|----------------|-------------|
| <= 25%         | red         |
| 25% > x < 75%  | orange      |
| \>= 75%        | green       |
| charging       | blue        |
